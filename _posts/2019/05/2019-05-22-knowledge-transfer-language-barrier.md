In the technology and development circles, there is a lot of talk about the digital divide and how it negatively impacts economic development and the development gap that currently exists between the nations. In my opinion, the gap does not stop at the technology and digital economy levels, but also further exacerbates the knowledge gap between the communities which is driven by the fact that most of the potential scientists and students of Science who have the intelligence and the acumen to learn new skills and absorb new 'organized' knowledge do not speak English.

Most of the content and educational materials and resources out there are written in English, and despite the individual's intelligence and ability to learn the learning curve gets steeper as one has to achieve certain levels of fluency in all the language skills (reading, writing, listening comprehension, etc). An obvious phenomena in educational settings is that students with good English language skills usually have a better mastery of the skills and topics taught in school. and have a greater potential at self-teaching, especially in the computing and sciences disciplines.

A better approach to knowledge and skill transfer is to use a native language as the medium of instruction. It has its own challenges and barriers to successful implementation, starting with the fact that there is limited content in the local language, and that most languages might lack sufficient terminology for science, engineering and technology disciplines.

Organizations with a world vision to promote knowledge transfer and skills development in specific disciplines such as the case of the Carpentries will have a far-reaching impact on the communities they serve, and will in turn grow in strength and capabilities, if there is a clear strategy for content delivery and localization. Since most of the available literature and material is in English, a mixed approach where the content is developed in English and translated into local languages but the delivery is localized might achieve a much-needed balance where the departure from the core content and thus the values and strategy for knowledge delivery is limited, and the participants in the knowledge and skill transfer get the most out of the training sessions and gain useful skills and 'organized' knowledge - knowledge that can be applied to solve actual, real-world problems.

A cornerstone to this proposed strategy is to review the training of trainers program of the Carpentries to ensure that the potential trainers can deliver in their local languages effectively while still maintaining the guidelines required of the Carpentries instructors.
