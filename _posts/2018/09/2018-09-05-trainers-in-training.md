We recently put out [a call for applications](http://static.carpentries.org/blog/2018/07/apply-to-train/) from current Instructors
wanting to become Carpentries Trainers. 

Trainers are key to the continuing growth and success of the Carpentries. They teach our Instructor Training curriculum, 
which then brings new Instructors into the Carpentries community.

We are excited to announce that the following people will be joining the next round of training to start on 10 September.

* Reed A. Cartwright
* Arindam	Basu
* Guilherme Castelao
* Kate Hertweck
* Eric Jankowski
* Tendai Marengereke
* Mamana Mbiyavanga
* Kerensa McElroy
* Katerina Michalickova
* Francisco Palm
* Nicolas Palopoli
* Alan Ponce
* Chris Prince Udochukwu Njoku
* Sarah Pugachev
* David R. Pugh
* Benjamin Schwessinger
* Malvika Sharan
* Sarah Stevens
* Darya Vanichkina

We look forward to welcoming them to the Trainer community.
