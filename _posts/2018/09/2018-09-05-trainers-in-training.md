We recently put out [a call for applications](http://static.carpentries.org/blog/2018/07/apply-to-train/) from members of our community
who want to become Carpentries Trainers. The call was open to current Instructors and other qualified community members, for example,
people with existing teaching or training experience.

Our Trainers are key to the continuing growth and success of the Carpentries. They teach our Instructor Training curriculum, 
which then brings new Instructors into the Carpentries community.

We are excited to announce that the following people will be joining the next round of training to start on 10 September.

* Reed A. Cartwright (USA)
* Arindam	Basu (New Zealand)
* Guilherme Castelao
* Kate Hertweck (USA)
* Eric Jankowski
* Tendai Marengereke
* Mamana Mbiyavanga
* Kerensa McElroy (Australia)
* Katerina Michalickova
* Francisco Palm (Venezuela)
* Nicolas Palopoli (Argentina)
* Alan Ponce
* Chris Prince Udochukwu Njoku
* Sarah Pugachev
* David R. Pugh
* Benjamin Schwessinger
* Malvika Sharan (Germany)
* Sarah Stevens (USA)
* Darya Vanichkina (Australia)

We look forward to welcoming them to the Trainer community.
