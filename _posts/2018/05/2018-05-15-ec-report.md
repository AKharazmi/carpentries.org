May 2018 is almost over
and The Carpentries Executive Council
wants to provide a brief report of their activities
during the first four months of 2018.
We are slowly getting to know each other,
our role as Executive Council
and what it means that we now are a single organisation.

Executive Council members are listed at [Governance page](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/)
where you can also find links to the minutes of the Executive Council monthly meetings.

## Finances

The first thing the Executive Councl had to look were the finances
and The Carpentries should be very healthy for the rest of 2018
based on the projection.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Operations

At the time of the merge,
most of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
activities were already shared
but we still have a few minor details
in operations that are still different.
The Executive Council is advising
staff in the best way to align operations
of both organisations
and facilitate the onboarding process
of future member organisations.

## Mission & Vision

A major taks will be to determine the Mission and Vision statements of the new organisation.
We are preparing a process where the community will be asked for suggestions.
Based on this input, the Executive Council will prepare a draft text and collect feedback on it.

## Bylaws

As a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/),
The Carpentries isn't required to have Bylaws
but the Executive Council believes that having this kind of document is important
so most of the time in the previous four months was devoted to drafting the Bylaws for the new organisation.
The new Bylaws are inspired by the one from Software Carpentry
and those of other similar non-profit organisations.
The Executive Council hopes to open a Request for Comments (RFC)
around July after the Executive Council meet in-person on middle of June.

## Talk with us
