May 2018 is almost over
and The Carpentries Executive Council
wants to provide a briefly report of their activities
during the first four months of 2018.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Operations

At the time of the merge,
most of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
activities were already shared
but we still have a few minor details
in operations that are orthogonal.
The Executive Council is advising
staffs in the best way to align operations
of both organisations
and facilitate the on boarding process
of future member organisations.

## By Laws

As a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/),
The Carpentries isn't required to have By Laws
but the Executive Council believes that have this kind of document is important
so most of the time in the previous four months were devoted to this activity.
The new By Laws is inspired by Software Carpentry's one
and other similar organisations.
The Executive Council hopes to open a Request for Comments (RFC)
around July after the in-person meeting.
