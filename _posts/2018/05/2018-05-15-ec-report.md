May 2018 is almost over
and The Carpentries Executive Council
wants to provide a brief report of their activities
during the first four months of 2018.

Executive Council members are listed at [Governance page](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/).

## Finances

The first thing the Executive Councl had to look were the finances
and The Carpentries should be very healthy for the rest of 2018
based on the projection.

## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Operations

At the time of the merge,
most of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
activities were already shared
but we still have a few minor details
in operations that are orthogonal.
The Executive Council is advising
staff in the best way to align operations
of both organisations
and facilitate the onboarding process
of future member organisations.

## Mission & Vision

TODO

## Bylaws

As a fiscally sponsored project of [Community Initiatives](http://communityin.org/),
The Carpentries isn't required to have Bylaws
but the Executive Council believes that having this kind of document is important
so most of the time in the previous four months were devoted to drafting the Bylaws for the new organisation.
The new Bylaws are inspired by Software Carpentry's one
and those of other similar.
The Executive Council hopes to open a Request for Comments (RFC)
around July after the Executive Council meet in-person on middle of May.
