Over the last few months, The Carpentries has seen a growing interest in individuals, research groups, and institutions wanting to develop lessons for their own domain of research. We are very excited by the potential brought by this growth. Diversifying our lesson offering means that we can extend our reach to new communities, and disseminate further our practices of teaching and collaborative lesson development. We also want to ensure that the lessons we offer continue to be of the same high-quality level as our members, Instructors, and learners expect. Here, we are outlining our vision and plans to support this growth in curricula while sustaining existing lessons and our organization.

The vision and plans outlined here are divided into two stages:

1. Between now and early 2019, we’ll be focusing on establishing the
   infrastructure needed to support lesson development and scaling up our lesson
   offering;
2. Starting in January 2019, we’ll have new pathways to onboard lessons.

## The Curriculum Development book and training

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry lessons are designed around a few core principles informed by the results from the sciences of teaching and learning. We take an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice, we develop learners’ confidence and lay the foundation for future learning. Our curricula are collaboratively developed and need to be written and organized so other Instructors can teach them.

Developing curriculum is a craft. Lessons that have recently been added to The Carpentries workshop offering have received considerable input from staff members to ensure that developers are guided through this process. We strive to ensure that lesson content matches the skill level of the intended audience and that the lessons can be taught by Instructors who were not involved in their development. As we expand our curricula to new domains, we want to empower lesson developers and maintainers by:

- Articulating and clarifying the elements that constitute a Carpentries lesson;
- Identifying the skills that should be included in the lessons;
- Providing guidelines on how to choose relevant datasets; and
- Advising on best-practices for lesson design.

To this end, we are writing a [Handbook on Curriculum Development](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development) geared towards assembling lessons for The Carpentries. It will also include useful general principles for anyone interested in developing Carpentries-style teaching materials.

We have been hearing from The Carpentries’ community that there is an interest in having a Curriculum Development workshop, and we plan to develop that as well. While our Instructor Training focuses on instructional pedagogy and teaching Carpentries workshops, our Curriculum Development training will focus more on the curriculum development side and teach participants how to design and write Carpentries-style lessons. This training will equip our community with the skills needed to write lessons to be used in Carpentries workshops or in other contexts. We expect to release the handbook in early 2019, and we will begin to pilot our curriculum development training in March 2019.


## New lesson template and tools

As we grow the number of lessons we support, and to make it easier for lesson developers to get started with writing lessons, we are working on developing new tools and templates for teaching materials across all of our lessons. The Carpentries recently received a [grant](https://github.com/carpentries/2018-r-consortium-lessondown-proposal/releases/download/v1.20180401/proposal.pdf) from the R Consortium Infrastructure Committee complementing the existing [Sloan Foundation grant](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2018/02/curriculum-dev-scaling) to support some of the development of this project. Planning and prototyping have started, and the lesson infrastructure committee will provide updates and opportunities for feedback in the coming months. 


## New Pathways for lesson contributions with The Carpentries

To support community-led efforts in developing lessons for other types of data or to extend existing lessons to new domains, The Carpentries plans to offer a venue to develop lessons. Initially this will be a repository for community development of lessons (https://github.com/carpentrieslab), with the vision of moving to a format where we will provide an editorial role, and our community of Instructors will provide open peer-review on these lessons, much as [rOpenSci does for R packages](http://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/). 

We know that discoverability of high quality lessons is one of the challenges for instructors looking to use materials in short-format workshops or semester-long courses. The [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) are just as important for lessons as they are for data. The goal with this lesson development framework is that the community can take advantage of the resources and tools developed by The Carpentries to develop lessons that will use the pedagogical approach and techniques used by our organization. While some might become formal parts of Carpentry workshops, others may be on topics or domains that might be too specific to be offered as an officially-supported curriculum. Additionally, to aid in discoverability and support credit for lesson development, we are planning to partner with the [Journal of Open Science Education](http://jose.theoj.org/) to provide a venue for authors of these lessons to be credited for their efforts by having an official publication. 

Lessons developed with this model are aimed to last 2 to 4 hours. This format will allow them to be included as short modules of our official workshops. More importantly, we envision that they will be a vital element of the local Carpentries communities. Not only these lessons can be taught at local community meetups, but we also envision that local Carpentries communities will collaborate on developing these lessons during the authoring phase, pilot them, provide feedback, and engage in collaborative peer-review to improve them. These activities are opportunities for Instructors to get a chance to practice their teaching skills and gain experience in lesson design.

Many research groups are interested in developing curriculum in collaboration with The Carpentries as part of research grants. These researchers want to support our organization and our community, and want to benefit from the global reach of The Carpentries and the community contributions that improve our lesson materials. We want to welcome these initiatives with more formal levels of support, which will allow us to provide mentoring and assistance during the development of these curricula, as well as the onboarding of Instructors and Maintainers. We will start incorporating these options in our membership fee structure in early 2019. The pricing for these levels of support are not established yet, and will be adjusted based on whether your organization is also a member of The Carpentries, your financial constraints, and the demand for the lessons you are proposing to develop in collaboration with us.

We will be introducing these pathways progressively, and we will provide regular updates on their deployments through our [blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/) and our [newsletter](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/). At this stage, we are not accepting lessons to be considered for peer-review by our community, but we expect to be able to do so in early 2019. If you are interested in being an early-adopter and want to include us in grant proposals to develop lessons in partnership with The Carpentries, please get in touch with [François](mailto:francois@carpentries.org). 

These additions and changes to our Curriculum structure will provide additional venues for our community to engage, contribute to  lessons, and have a significant impact in how learners are introduced to foundational data and computing skills all over the world. We’re excited for more of the collaborative and open curriculum development that is core to The Carpentries!
