Applications are open for our next round of mentoring! 
You can apply to be a [mentor](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXySJkJrl4uVQyyUmohBnBGlJMfPj7Mis0JqU-awOHvGug2A/viewform) 
or a [mentee](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfShPoHabyLUMe5894zn-h5hJGY6OH1sffBYKZML3QfHHfSWQ/viewform). 

#### Who can mentor?
Instructors who have taught at least two workshops are eligible to serve as mentors. It is a great way to share the experience you 
have picked up from teaching others. Please don't feel that if you are a new-ish instructor, you won't have useful advice
to share. Your perspective will be immensely valuable to others who are just starting out. And your 'pathway' will resonate as your 
mentees seek to find their own pathways to engagement with the Carpentries both globally and within their local communities. So please banish
any thoughts of 'impostor syndrome' and sign on to mentor today. Mentoring is a key skill, one well worth developing for your CV.

#### Who is a mentee?
Mentee applications are open to instructors who have taught fewer than two workshops. You can be mentored on a range 
of things: getting through the checkout process, contributing to lessons, organising workshops, or building a local community. 
You decide. Being a part of a group that addresses something important to you is both powerful and enjoyable. Mentoring groups are 
beneficial to participants because group members are able to focus on specific goals.

Applications for both roles close on Friday, 31 August. Get yours in today!
