We are thrilled to announce that Serah Njambi Rono will be joining The Carpentries as Community Engagement Lead in January 2019. She will
also be representing The Carpentries as a 2019 Fellow in the Community Engagement Fellowship Program run by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science ([AAAS](https://www.aaas.org/)).

Serah has over five years experience as an open data and open source
advocate, and brings with her a wealth of experience in community building and coordination, in developing and implementing curricula
and outreach strategies, and translating complex technical topics into content that is easy to understand. Most recently, she worked as
a Developer Advocate for [Open Knowledge International](https://okfn.org/). Before that, she worked with [Code for Africa](https://codeforafrica.org/).
Through her work, she has developed a wealth of experience developing and teaching technical workshops and engaging with communities
around technical training. 

In her new role, Serah will work to create a more cohesive and collaborative environment for our community initiatives, build and engage
local and global Carpentry communities, and develop a program to support regional Carpentries community leaders.

Serah believes that any work she engages in is only as meaningful as the change it propels in grassroots communities, and that the work
does not stop until all communities are at par in terms of access to resources, opportunities, and empowerment by information that this
opens them up to. This is the measure by which she defines impact, and as part of The Carpentries core team, she is keen to immerse herself
in the community, apply her expertise, learn, adapt and grow in the process. You can find her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/serahrono),
[GitHub](https://github.com/serahrono), or drop her a note on
email.

Serah earned a degree in Computer Science at the [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/) 
in Nairobi, Kenya. She is currently located in Tallinn, Estonia. Welcome to the team Serah!
