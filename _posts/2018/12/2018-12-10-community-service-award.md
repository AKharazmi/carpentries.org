The Carpentries Executive Council is happy announce that Tim Dennis, Margareth Gfrerer and Toby Hodges received the 2018 Community Service Award and Malvika Sharan and Fotis Psomopoulosa special CarpentryCon Community Award..  Thank you for contributions to the community of The Carpentries!

## Community Service Award

The Community Service Award was created to recognise some of the  exceptional work by volunteers in our community. These awards are nominated by the community and selected by the Executive Council. "Exceptional work" can mean many things, for example attending community calls when you have poor internet connection, , changing your calendar to attend committee meetings or finding the time to not only teach but help support and coordinate  workshops or instructor training events. Some of this work is more visible in our community and others is more ‘behind the scenes’. All have made exceptional contributions, not just to activities, but to supporting and developing others in the community. The Executive Council is pleased to award the 2018 Community Service Award to Tim Dennis, Margareth Gfrerer and Toby Hodges for their tremendious work that together represents what The Carpentry community is, and exemplifies our spirit of ‘further together’.

## CarpentryCon Community Award

CarpentryCon was envisioned to be our first global in-person event to bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, develop new skills, and develop strategies for building strong local communities in an inclusive and welcoming environment. A first global meeting, let alone one with these broad goals, is an enormous challenge. Even with thousands of hours spent in preparation, we always have butterflies in our stomach until it happens. The Executive Council created this award to acknowledge the tremendous from Malvika Sharan and Fotis Psomopoulos in establishing CarpentryCon. They did a exceptional work in joining all the jigsaw pieces involved in organising the first conference, and their success inspired local events in 2018 and 2019 and plans for another global meeting in 2020.
