The Executive Council met face-to-face for the first time last week (June 18-19) in Gainesville. So, this seems like a good time to give everyone a sense of what we discussed at the in-person meeting, and what is in store for the next several months.  

# Why an 'Executive Council'?

First, I want to talk about the name 'Executive Council'. Why are we an EC, and not a 'Board of Directors'? In the US, that title has a specific meaning, and suggests financial and legal responsibility. Because we are not our own non-profit, but are fiscally sponsored by Community Initiatives, we do not have our own Board of Directors (noting that CI, which _is_ a non-profit,  _does_ have a Board of Directors). We also felt that 'Executive Council' better captured the level of commitment and responsibility of the members than 'Steering Committee' (thinking about getting credit, often on academic CVs, for the work of the EC).

# In-person meeting outcomes

Now that we're past the name, let's talk about the recent EC meeting in Florida. While we have been meeting online for the past few months, many members of the EC had not met face to face. An important part of this meeting was to better get to know each other and to build trust so that we can interact virtually in a way that we feel comfortable voicing our opinions, challenging each other, and respecting our differences.

## Mission and Vision

We spent good chunk of the first day talking about Mission and Vision. We did a brainstorming session about what sort of world the Carpentries was trying to create, which produced many lists of goals, activities leading to goals, and values that underlie it all.  While we didn't come out with a final mission and vision, the general themes were very consistent among the EC. most notably a shared passion around building communities that are inclusive, diverse, and accessible (and the idea that building communities is as important as teaching workshops). Karen, Ethan, and Mateusz are leading the next phase of that process, which is to formalize the vision (what we imagine), the mission (what we do to get there), and the values that inform how we operate.

## Strategic planning

With a general consensus on vision and mission, we turned to strategic planning. Tracy, the Carpentries staff, and the many community leaders have been doing a heroic job running the new organization since the merger, and the job of the EC is to provide overall direction for the organization. We created a timeline for the next few months (now through next elections in winter 2018) that includes 1) mission & vision; 2) Carpentries bylaws (including roles and responsibilities of the EC); 3) elections; and 4) information gathering in preparation for long-term strategic planning.

## Communication

We realize that the EC has not been as good about communication as we need to be (and that simply putting our meeting notes in a public repo is not nearly enough). Expect to see requests for community feedback, starting with the mission and vision in July. We also have a series of EC blog posts planned, so that we are more transparent about what we are doing.

## General feelings of excitement

Just want to wrap up by saying that I am very excited about working with everyone on the EC. Over the two days in Gainesville, we navigated challenging conversations, heard a diversity of opinions, had our minds changed, shared much laughter, and were always motivated by the vision and values of the Carpentries. Looking forward to the next few months!
