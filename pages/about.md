<h4>
About The Carpentries
</h4>
The Carpentries project comprises <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a>, communities of Instructors, Trainers, Maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach foundational computational and data science skills to researchers. 

The Carpentries subscribes to a shared <a href="http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. In January, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged their projects to form <strong>The Carpentries</strong>. This <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/09/merger.html">blog post</a> provides some background. Visit the individual <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/">Data Carpentry</a> web sites for more detailed project histories.

<h4>
How is The Carpentries Managed?
</h4>

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of <a href="http://communityin.org/">Community Initiatives</a>, 
a registered 501(c)3 non-profit based in California, USA. Tracy Teal is the Executive Director, and governance of the merged Carpentries is undertaken 
by an <a href="{{site.url}}/governance">Executive Council</a> which comprises 
four community-elected members and five appointed members drawn from 
the previous Steering Committees of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry.

<h4>
How is The Carpentries Funded?
</h4>

We now have more than 70 [member organisations]({{site.url}}members/) in 10 countries. Collectively these [memberships]({{site.url}}members/) generate 58.8% of our revenue. Workshop fees bring in 18.6% of our annual revenue, and grants and donations account for 22.4% of revenue. These income streams support the work of our small [staff]({{site.url}}/team/).

You can donate to The Carpentries <a href="https://carpentries.wedid.it/">through this portal</a>.

<h4>
What Information is Where?
</h4>

What is common across both Carpentries - the Code of Conduct, assessment, governance, instructor training, our privacy policy - will be found through this site, while Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry-specific material, such as lessons, will remain on the individual [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) sites. We will increasingly post on the Carpentries [blog]({{site.url}}/blog/), rather than to individual Carpentries blog sites. 

<h4>
What is a Carpentries Workshop?
</h4>

<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/">Software Carpentry</a> workshops 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/">Data Carpentry</a> workshops generally 
comprise two full days of face-to-face instruction, based on 
either <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
or <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lesson materials, respectively. 

Workshops are taught by volunteer Instructors. Certified Instructors comprise people who 
have completed our <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training</a> course. A typical workshop has two instructors, and 2-3 helpers answering questions during practical sessions. (These helpers are often alumni of previous workshops who are hoping to become instructors themselves.)

Short bursts of teaching via live coding alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what they are learning to their own research problems during, between, and after sessions.

<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons">Software Carpentry</a> 
and <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons">Data Carpentry</a> lessons are all 
open source, and are hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.

<h4>
Referencing The Carpentries
</h4>

The Carpentries, while sounding plural, is a singular entity. Therefore, when referring to The Carpentries, verbs should also be singular, e.g. *'The Carpentries is ...'*. The correct title for the merged organisation is **The Carpentries**. However, you can use terminology such as *'A Carpentries workshop ...'*.

We appreciate being mentioned in the acknowledgments sections of papers, theses, and proposals, as it helps us show current and potential funders what impact we are having. If you would like to acknowledge The Carpentries, please use wording like this:

> We were aided in this work by the training and other support offered by The Carpentries [1]. 
> [1] The Carpentries https://carpentries.org

<h4>
The Carpentries in the Literature
</h4>

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry have both been featured in many publications, and some members of the Carpentries community have written materials about our workshops, our history, and our impact. See our <a href="{{site.url}}/citations/">citations</a> page for a list. Comprehensive reports about our impact can be found in our <a href="{{site.url}}/assessment/">assessment</a> section.
