The CarpentryCon Task Force's mission is organise and host a meeting every two years to bring together members of the global 
Carpentries community
and people with similar interests. In 2018, the Task Force organised the very successful inaugural CarpentryCon. 
A call is currently out for new members to join the Task Force to build the next CarpentryCon, scheduled for 2020.

_Our Goal:_    
To organise an event that will bring together and skill up members of the global Carpentries community and people with similar interests.

_Our Approach:_    
We hold monthly [meetings](https://pad.carpentries.org/2018carpentrycontaskforce). At the moment, we are reviewing the 
last CarpentryCon so as to be better placed to organise the next. We are looking for volunteers to join the Task Force.

_Our Structure:_    
The Task Force has monthly meetings, which are open to new members. Meetings are scheduled, organised, and 
run through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/2018carpentrycontaskforce). We also organise information
about our work and record minutes of meetings though this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon).

_Our Leadership:_    
Fotis Psomopoulos and Malvika Sharan are the current co-Chairs of the Task Force.
