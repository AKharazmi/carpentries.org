####  CarpentryCon Task Force

The mission of the 2018 task force was to organise and host a meeting to bring together members of the global Carpentries community and people with similar interests. That resulted in the very successful inaugural CarpentryCon 2018. A call will soon go out for new members to join the task force to build the next CarpentryCon.
