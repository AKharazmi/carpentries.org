This group works to build a sustainable and active Carpentries community in Latin America. This group also includes the 
Spanish Translators Team. That team translates and maintains [Spanish-language Carpentries lessons](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES). 

**_Our Goal:_**    
To build a strong Carpentries community right across Latin America.

**_Our Approach:_**    
The Spanish Translators Team has regular meetings. See the [minutes of past meetings](https://github.com/carpentries/latinoamerica/tree/master/traducciones/minutos). 

**_Our Structure:_**    
The group is large and roles overlap between the many different activities.

**_Current Members:_**    
The group has too many members to list here.

**_Contacting Carpentries en Latinoamérica:_**
