<p>The Carpentries works to help institutions and individuals spread skills for data analysis, computational thinking, 
  and research software development through building local and global communities of practice.</p>

<p>Our work is far reaching and is made possible by the efforts of our amazing volunteer Instructors, Trainers, Mentors, Maintainers,  
curriculum advisors, helpers, workshop hosts and organisers, community champions, and member organisations who all contribute to our 
mission of teaching researchers the coding and data skills they need to 
  conduct open, reproducible science. </p>

  <p>Why not join us? No matter where you come from, be assured that <em>you</em> belong in The Carpentries.</p>
