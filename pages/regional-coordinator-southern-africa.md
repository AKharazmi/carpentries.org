The Carpentries is an open global community teaching the skills and perspectives to turn data into knowledge. We build capacity in
essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. Through our mission, we are committed 
to “training and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors who promote and model the importance of 
software and data in research.” We believe in a world where more people have the computational skills and perspectives to work with data 
to address their questions in science, scholarship, and society. We aim to build that world by scaling evidence-based teaching, creating 
inclusive environments, and building communities of practice based on open principles.
