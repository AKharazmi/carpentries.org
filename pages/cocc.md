The Carpentries is dedicated to developing and empowering a diverse community of enthusiasts around computational methods 
for research and data science. To facilitate this, the Carpentries have established a Code of Conduct that governs 
behaviour within the community. The CoC committee was established to enforce the Code, and to manage any changes and updates to it.

#### Current Members

[**Samantha Ahern**](https://github.com/quirksahern) is a member of the Digital Education team at University College London (UCL) in the UK. Her time is split between learning analytics and learning design projects. She is a qualified teacher (PGCE Secondary ICT) and Fellow of the HEA, has earned BSc(Hons) Computer Science and MSc Intelligent Systems degrees plus PGDip IT in Education. She has benefited from the Carpentries training, is a Carpentries Instructor and helps organise workshops at UCL. Samantha is committed to inclusive and accessible education for all, her motivation for participation in the CoC committee is to ensure that we are an inclusive community and that our learning materials and environments are as accessible as possible to all.

[**Kari L. Jordan**](https://github.com/kariljordan) is the Director of Assessment and Community Equity for The Carpentries. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Michigan Technological University, and an MA and PhD in Engineering Education from The Ohio State University. She has been on the staff for The Carpentries since August 2016. Her motivation for participating in the CoC committee is to ensure we are creating welcoming and inclusive environments in our workshops.

[**Karin Lagesen**](https://github.com/karinlag) is the current Chair of this Committee. She is a bioinformatician working at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute. Her time is spent building pipelines, teaching people how to analyze their data, and finding new and better ways of using bioinformatics for microbial surveillance. She was part of the Software Carpentry Steering Committee for three years, and is also an instructor trainer. Karin is part of this committee because she believes it is very important to ensure that the Carpentries is a safe and inclusive community.

[**Malvika Sharan**](https://github.com/malvikasharan) is a computational biologist at European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany. She is a Community Outreach Coordinator of EMBL Bio-IT project and works closely with ELIXIR Germany (de.NBI) with her training and community engagement activities. She became The Carpentries trainer in 2015 while carrying out her Ph.D. research in bioinformatics. She hosts and teaches at multiple Carpentries workshops in Europe. She engage with the Carpentries community by contributing to the mentoring program, instructor's discussions and CarpentryCon+Connect Taskforce. She co-chaired the 1st Carpentry Conference and counts it as one of the most rewarding experiences of her life! Her motivation for participating in the Carpentry CoC stems from her passion for promoting inclusiveness and accessibility in science.

[**Simon Waldman**](https://github.com/swaldman3) is a postdoc at Heriot-Watt University in the UK, working at the intersection of physical oceanography and renewable energy. He has been involved in a range of online communities since the 1990s, and feels strongly about encouraging inclusive behaviour. He has benefited from Carpentries training, and occasionally helps on workshops.

[**Ethan White**](https://github.com/ethanwhite) is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida working on
computational and data-intensive ecology. He is a Moore Foundation Investigator
in Data Driven Discovery and serves on the board of directors of Impactstory. He
has been involved in Software Carpentry since 2009, was a founding member of
the Data Carpentry steering committee, wrote the first version of the Data
Carpentry Ecology SQL material, and leads the development of the semester long
Data Carpentry course for biologists. He serves as the Executive Council representative
on the committee.
