The Carpentries develop and teach in-person, interactive, hands-on, two-day workshops for learning core skills in research computing. Carpentries workshops are
taught by volunteer [Instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/), [trained in pedagogy](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), who focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. All our lessons are open source, hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and collaboratively developed by our volunteer community. 

### What makes our workshops special?

Our workshops incorporate a number of teaching practices that make them effective and enjoyable.

#### <i class="fas fa-smile"></i> Our workshops are welcoming

All our workshops must abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). As a community that values diversity and inclusivity, dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people regardless of background or identity, our Code of Conduct sits at the very heart of everything we do. Among other things, our Code of Conduct states:

*We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.*

Knowing that the workshop will be safe and welcoming really helps people feel relaxed and ready to learn. We have [tips for Instructors](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/instructor_tips.html#talking-about-the-code-of-conduct) on how to introduce the Code of Conduct at the start of workshops.

#### <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> We use live coding

Using the UNIX command line or working in Jupyter Notebooks or RStudio helps familiarise people with the tools they will be using post-workshop. The pace is necessarily slow because the Instructor is typing rather than just paging through Powerpoint slides. See more about [why live coding helps learners](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/index.html).

#### <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Mistakes are made

Instructors invariably make typos when they use live coding. Watching Instructors diagnose and fix errors helps learners figure out how to deal with their own errors. It also makes the Instructor more relatable.

#### <i class="fas fa-people-carry"></i> Peers are teaching peers

Unlike workshops where 'experts' deliver the word from on high, many of our workshops are taught by people who have recently been learners themselves. This creates a much less intimidating environment for learners.

#### <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> People use their own laptops

Working on their own laptops at workshops helps people feel more comfortable getting started. When they leave the workshop, everything they need to continue using and learning the tools is set up for them.

#### <i class="fas fa-question"></i> It is easy to get help

We use a system of sticky notes to allow people to seek help without calling attention to themselves or interrupting the Instructor. People are issued sticky notes of two different colours - generally red and green - and use them to signal 'it's all good' or 'I need help'. When they post a red sticky, helpers in the room assist them to get back on track.

#### <i class="fas fa-users"></i> It's not just the Instructor teaching

Workshops generally have a number of helpers in the room who assist the Instructor by keeping people on track and caught up. People signal for help by means of the sticky note system. Helpers often pass on useful tips to learners.

#### <i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Feedback is continuous

The same sticky notes are used for feedback throughout the workshop. As people leave for lunch or breaks, they write (anonymously) one plus (something they liked) and one minus (something they didn't like or are still confused about) on the sticky notes, which they leave in a heap on the table as they leave the room. Instructors go through the feedback in the break and address it at the start of the next section, i.e. they might speed up or slow down, or go over a section again that learners are still confused about. That way, the workshop stays closer to what learners actually need.

#### <i class="fas fa-vial"></i> Testing understanding

Live coding by the Instructor is broken up by the working through of challenges that test what learners have grasped. Responses help the Instructor see what learners are missing, or what misconceptions they might have that need to be addressed. This allows for confusion to be cleared up before the class moves on.

#### <i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Collaborative notes

All our workshops use etherpads - collaborative, web-based notepads that allow people to share information, links, or to chat to each other. Instructors post links to all the lessons being taught, and people can add links to handy tips or bits of code that others can then share. Etherpads persist after the workshop ends so people can go back over things they might have missed.

We provide a lot of guidance for [teaching and hosting](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html)  workshops.
