The African Task Force supports the growing Carpentries community across African countries by mentoring new Instructors and providing 
logistical support for workshops.

**_Our Goal:_**       
To build a strong Carpentries community across Africa.

**_Our Approach:_**       
We host a monthly African instructor meetup. This has been running since 2017. We discuss topics of interest to researchers and 
students in the African context, including previous and upcoming workshops, available resources, opportunities, and events, and more.
We also mentor Instructors and Helpers before a workshop to ensure everyone knows what to expect and what is expected of them. There 
are many ways to [get 
involved](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html#join-us).
